   <li class="FAQs"> Who sets the Fee? Is there any scope for negotiation? </li> 
   <ul class="bullets"> <li> Fee is set by the SpacePartner. SpaceBoat makes a recommendation to a SpacePartner at the time of tie-up, but the final fee chart is set by a SpacePartner.  </li>
   <li>  A potential User has the option to send <u> <i> only one </i> </u> counter proposal based on their requirement. A SpacePartner can then accept or reject the counter proposal.   </li>
    <li> If SpacePartner rejects the counter proposal, SpaceUser will then have to accept the original fee. Second counters will not be entertained. </li> </ul>

   <li class="FAQs"> How long can I reserve the space for? What will be the term/tenure? </li>
    <ul class="bullets"> <li> For as long and short as you want, subject to minimum fee thresholds set by a SpacePartner. </li> 
    <li> For requirements up to 2 months - refer to our Workshop / Short Term Courses plan.  </li>

  <ul class="bullets"> <li> Yes, you can. A shared support staff member will be present on the premises to help you with any furniture rearrangement.  </li>
  <li> This is a shared support staff member who might be helping other SpaceUsers on the premises help set up as well. Please be patient 
    </li>
  <li> This shared support staff member is NOT responsible for the safety of your students or to supervise them in case your students (young children) need to go to the washroom. If you need a nanny for these purposes, charges will be extra.  </li>

  <li class="FAQs"> Can I bring my own furniture?  </li>
  <ul class="bullets"> <li> If the furniture that you require does not exist at the SpacePartner’s premises, you can bring your own additional furniture, subject to a SpacePartner’s approval </li>  </ul>

  <ul class="bullets"> <li> You will have to secure your own internet as per your requirement.  </li>  </ul>

  <ul class="bullets"> <li> You can use the SpacePartner’s address as venue location in your marketing collaterals only <u> after </u> reserving the space.  </li>
  	<li> We strongly recommend that you reserve the space before beginning marketing of the program. If you haven’t reserved the space and end up forming a batch, you might be risking your revenue and reputation if the SpacePartner denies the request to host your program.  
    </li> </ul> 

 <li class="FAQs"> What if I am not able to form my batches after reserving the space? What if I get more students than anticipated?  </li> 
 <ul class="bullets" > <li> If you do not get the desired response to your marketing efforts, don’t worry - 
                           <ul class="bullets"> <li> You can claim a full refund of the security deposit and the monthly fee, if you inform us up to 5 days in advance of the start date. </li>

 <ul class="bullets"> <li> You can reserve the space for Trial classes under the Workshop Plans and pay an amount accordingly. And a separate amount for your recurring monthly classes as per the monthly plans.  </li>
                   <li> After your trial classes, if you choose not to continue, the amount and the security deposit for the monthly recurring classes will be refunded to you  </li>
                   <li> We strongly recommend that you reserve the space for both the trial period and the recurring monthly course separately. In case your trial classes result in enrolments, you do not want the headache of having to look for alternate venue in case your request for monthly classes is denied subsequently.  </li> </ul>

 <li class="FAQs"> Can I change my requirement in subsequent months, after I have started? </li> 
 <ul class="bullets"> <li> Yes you can. The SpaceBoat solution offers you complete flexibility.

<li class="FAQs"> Will there be a waiting area for parents?  </li>
<ul class="bullets"> <li> Most SpacePartners on SpaceBoat have a strict ‘drop-off’ policy on the premises. A parent is required to drop off the child and leave the premises, unless they are required to be present in the class with the child (as in the case of mother-toddler programs).  </li>
<li> In cases where SpacePartners allow parents to wait on the premises, there will be a common designated waiting area allocated for the same. However, this is a shared facility and seating will be subject to availability.  </li> </ul>

<li class="FAQs"> How will I do my branding?  </li>

              <ul class="bullets"> <li> Venue Address - You will be able to use the SpacePartner’s name & location as venue address in your communication.  </li> 
              <li> Standees during class timings - You can put up standees in a high footfall area in the premises, while  your class is going on.    </li> </ul>

    	<ul class="bullets"> <li> Such common display board will be placed within the premises - along the passageway, or at the reception.  </li>
    	<li> A SpacePartner reserves the right to refuse the logo being displayed on the common board outside.  </li>
    	<li> There will be one-time set-up charges for this.  </li>
    	<li>  It will be a common display with logos of all other Users running their courses from the premises. For sample, 
    	<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1vxQWzHSCAaY0FnQ1d3QmMwXzg/view"> click Here </a> </li> </ul> </li> </li> </ul>

<li class="FAQs"> Who will answer the leads/walk-ins during our non-reserved hours? Who will collect the money from the students? </li>
<ul class="bullets"> <li> In case of a walk-in by a student outside your class hours, or a call received at the reception, the details of the lead will be noted down and will be transferred to you.  </li>
	<li> You will be responsible for fee collection from your students. </li> </ul> 

<li class="FAQs"> What all marketing support will I get? Can I do promotional activities for the students of the SpacePartner? Will SpaceBoat help me get more students?  </li>
<ul class="bullets"> <li> SpaceBoat is a primarily a space-sharing solution. Very few SpacePartners offer a little bit of marketing support including the following - 
<li> Mailers to parents regarding evening activities.  </li> 
 <li> Canopy/stalls on PTMs, carnivals etc.  </li> </li> 
<li> A SpacePartner reserves the right to refuse any marketing support to a SpaceUser. Such permission will be accepted or denied by a SpacePartner at the time of approving a SpaceUser’s program to operate from the premises.  </li>
<li> Please note, SpaceBoat does not undertake any service level accountability for marketing support by a SpacePartner. The quality of service and resultant outcome is outside the scope of SpaceBoat’s operations.  </li>
<li> If you use the SpacePartner’s resources for your own marketing efforts before you begin your program, security deposit and the advance fee will not be refundable.  </li>
<li> SpaceBoat is experimenting with separate avenues to help a SpaceUser with their marketing. This service is currently in beta. </li>
<li> For further details, read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdULQ7n6BjZDo3BnPjb5IST-VDBb1y-iRHhde27crro/edit"> Marketing Support Servies (beta)</a>  </li>  </ul> 

<li class="FAQs"> What about other competing programs? Will they be allowed to operate from the premises? </li> 
<ul class="bullets"> <li> SpaceBoat is open to holding discussions with any competing program until a SpaceUser reserves the place </li>  
 <li> Once a SpaceUser reserves the premises, SpaceBoat will not entertain any requests from a competing program during this period.</li>
 <li> However, SpaceBoat may explore the possibility of a competing program provider offering different courses than the ones being provided by the SpaceUser.  
 <ul class="bullets"> <li> Eg 1 - if a Dance provider is conducting Hip-Hop and Bollywood classes, SpaceBoat may invite partners offering Ballet, Salsa or Classical forms.  </li>
 	<li> Eg 2 - if a provider is conducting German Language Classes, SpaceBoat may invite partners offering Spanish, French classes, etc
 </li>
 <li> Eg 3 - if a provider is conducting digital marketing course, SpaceBoat may invite partners offering courses in Analytics, Coding, etc
 </li> 
  </ul> </li>
